  <p>
    JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, just-in-time
    compiled, object-oriented programming language that conforms to
    the ECMAScript specification.[10] JavaScript has curly-bracket
    syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and
    first-class functions.

    Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core
    technologies of the World Wide Web.[11] JavaScript enables
    interactive web pages and is an essential part of web
    applications. The vast majority of websites use it, and
    major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
